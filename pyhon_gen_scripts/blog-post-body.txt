Hopefully, you all had a good Halloween! Today we spent the first portion of class writing. We started with the sentence "Halloween was everywhere". This sentence brings a ton of things to mind. Everything within your schema. We wrote on the board everything that the class thought of including:
- Skeletons
- Costumes
- Pumpkins
- Candy
- etc...

Nick then gave a lesson on First-To-First writing, using the example of Bullet In The Brain. In cornerstone, we tend to teach Old-To-New writing.

Everyone then created a paragraph starting with the sentence "Halloween was everywhere", using the Old-To-New writing style.

As part of our lesson on writing styles, we also discussed Momentum. What is Momentum? Well, it's inertia in motion of course (mass x velocity)! But in the context of story-telling that meaning is 'slightly' skewed. Here are the two videos we watched in order to discuss momentum, and how it works within the context of telling a story.


We decided to remove Puddles from the reading list so your new homework list is below

read the following section from Ishmael by Daniel Quinn: 
- The second quarter of the text (pg. 79-148) 

and the following from Calvin and Hobbes: 
- Overpopulation (pg. 193) 
- Growing up (pg. 194-199)

I plan on introducing you guys to the myUniverse registration system sometime this week to show you how to register for classes. I'll let you know when!
