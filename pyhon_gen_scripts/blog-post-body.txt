Although some people seem to think we don't have class next time...we do. I'm not sure where you guys got this info, but I haven't heard anything. If class is canceled I'll make sure you are notified. Wednesday we continued our discussion of character and deconstructed the characters from Harvey. We split up into groups and each group deconstructed one character from the play. Next time we'll go over the remaining characters. I probably won't be able to set up a campus engagement this week, but I'll let you know Friday if I do. I just got my date to register for classes and it's still a few weeks away, so once we get closer to your enrollment date(s) I'll make sure to show you what to do, so don't worry.

Homework for Friday: 
read Harvey by Mary Chase (the whole thing) 

and the following from Calvin and Hobbes: 
- Binoculars (pg. 79-84) 
- Recess and Sports (pg. 120-129) 

Remember we're doing audio rundowns this week!
