Tomorrow we will be getting a group together to go to the Final Thursday reading(9/29). We will meet outside the classroom inside Lang hall at around 6:40 and then take off at around 6:45 (It's a ten-minute walk to get to the Hearst Center For the Arts). You should come. I'll send out another e-mail tommorrow morning. If you forgot what to write up for campus engagements click here. 

For real it's gunna be pretty dope so you should show up. As always updates will come via twitter as well.
