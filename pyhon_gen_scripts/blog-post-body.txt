Today we had a speech about paying student athletes which sparked a pretty good conversation in class. I believe we'll be having another speech on the same topic so stay tuned.	

After that, Zach gave a speech on suicide awareness and the better alternative to suicide. Both speeches were really good and all of the feedback was positive.

A REMINDER: Do not forget next Tuesday is the Real Community Workshop (another open mic event). I'll keep you guys updated with the info. Hope to see ya there!
