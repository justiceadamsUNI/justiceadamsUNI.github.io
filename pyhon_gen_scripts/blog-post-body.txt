Today again we had two speeches (As we will until the end of the semester). First Hailey gave a speech about teachers salaries and why we should push to improve them. Although Walter white is not a teacher per-say, I felt the header image was appropriate. 

Blair followed Hailey's speech with a presentation about the current state of Opera. Blair took everyone through the history of opera and its recent decline. Both speeches were well received and everyone agreed that they were bothy A level speeches.

Here's a link to a post about registering for classes if anyone has forgotten how to do so! If you need any help registering, questions about classes, or anything else don't hesitate to e-mail me or ask me in class/office hours.

I look forward to hearing the rest of your presentations!
