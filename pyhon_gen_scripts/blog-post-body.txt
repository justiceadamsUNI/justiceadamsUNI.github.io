Today we spent the entirety of the class discussing the stories we read for the week as an entire class. We decided to go about this differently and we went around and read portions of our favorite stories, as opposed to just discussing them. It's sometimes worthwhile to actually just let the text do the talking as we discuss our thoughts.

For next week the syllabus says to read stories from welcome to the monkey house, but we won't be doing any readings for next week. This is because on Wednesday we will be going to the UNI commons for a presentation on personal wellness, so we won't have regular class. This means that Monday, and Friday of next week we will go over other lessons. So no readings for next week, and go straight to the UNI commons for Wednesday's class (It's by 23rd Street Market). I'll also E-mail this all to you at some point.

Hopefully next week I can try to find another campus engagement to go to, and I can round up the squad. Stay tuned!
