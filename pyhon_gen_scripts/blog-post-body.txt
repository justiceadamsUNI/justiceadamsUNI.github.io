Today everyone spent the entire class sharing their research article for this week. It was pretty interesting and lead to some pretty interesting discussions. We talked about social media, sabermetrics in baseball, gun control, suicide among veterans, and paying student athletes.

We spent a fair amount of time discussing the controversy around paying student athletes. This crosses into my domain a bit more. Back in 2013 Electronic Arts (A major video game publishing company) announced their discontinuation of the NCAA football series, a series that sold millions of copies each year. If you wish to know more here's two articles for your pleasure. The game was discontinued after lawsuits regarding using the likeness of unpaid student athletes. This was a gigantic deal when it happened and this is the type of stuff I live for, so chek it out!

As we go forward, feel free to reach out if you need help/advice regarding your individual or group speeches.

Homework: For this Friday, finish your story about your character to the best of your ability and be prepared to share it with the class (we started these last Friday). If you write a really good piece and you print it off and turn it into Nick, you can get a check-plus out of the ordeal! Also be prepared to do group work with your squad on Wednesday.

Also, I've been informed that next Wednesday is another student services session so I'll keep you updated. (woohoo).
