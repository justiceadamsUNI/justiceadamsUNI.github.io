Hope everyone had an awesome first day. Today in class we mainly did introductory stuff. We then went over the definition of Schema - "an underlying organizational pattern or structure; conceptual framework". I took time to introduce everyone to the website, and of course the twitter feed (GO FOLLOW THE DAMN TWITTER) @cornerstone2k16.  The only section that is still a WIP on the website should be the events page. We will talk about that in class soon. We then broke up into groups after free writing about our educational based memories to discuss what we wrote.

Homework for next time: No formal reading assignment. Just brainstorm and think about your educational/learning based memories for discussion next time.

Also Here is the list of books *so far* that you should probably have by the selected dates. Don't freak out guys, we don't read the entire books as they are collections of short stories.

-Sept 14: We Live in Water + Calvin & Hobbes
-Sept 21: Welcome to the Monkey House
-Sept 28: Pretty Monsters
-Oct 7: The Night In Question
-Oct 14: Tenth of December

Hopefully you're excited for the coming year. It's going to be a lot of fun, and we're going to party hard.
