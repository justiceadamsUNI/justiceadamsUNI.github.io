Today we finished our discussion on the pillars we've used so far throughout the year. After the final group presented we briefly talked about each pillar and how one can see it's effect within almost every story. To further the point we watched an episode of Shark Tank. Shark Tank is a show where people pitch their business ideas to investors in hopes of becoming successful after being funded. We watched two segments from the episode below, but I'll link you to the Tree-Tee-Pee pitch (being that we spent more time discussing this). 


Think about exigency in the above clip. What's at stake for the investors? What's at stake for the tp man? How does this help/hurt his sales pitch? 
keep in mind you'll be doing something quite similar for your final project where you and a group will give a speech asking for funds. The rest of the class will be your investors. Incorporating the pillars to construct a good narrative can go a long way in such a speech :)

There isn't any rundown this week, but keep in mind you have a paper due before the semester. This paper consist of you defending your grade. Make a case for why you deserve whatever grade you think you've earned. Probably somewhere around ~2 pages, but as you know, we don't like length restrictions in our class. Did you show up every class, contribute to discussions, and turn in all your rundowns? Then make a case for why you deserve an A. If you do a good enough job on the paper, you might actually be able to achieve a higher grade. Take some time, but don't overthink it. Just give a well thought out argument for why you deserved whatever grade you think you've earned.
