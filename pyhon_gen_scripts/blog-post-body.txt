Today we had two speeches once again (Shocker, I know). Addie started us off with a speech on music education and why it's vital in the youth curriculum. She managed to end her speech with a video of her gospel choir from high school, which I thought was pretty neat.

Then Jacob L gave his speech on suicide prevention and the necessary steps to take in order to prevent suicide. Jacob's speech focused on males, as they have a higher suicide rate. Both speeches were very well done!

By now, you should be signed up for Fall 2017 classes (or at least have everything figured out), so consider this a reminder.

Also, April 11th is the next open mic reading! More on that later. Sorry for the short recap, but I suspect they will be this short for the rest of the year being that we are in "speech season". See you Wednesday!
