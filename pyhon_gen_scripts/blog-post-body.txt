Today we finished going over everyone's research articles for the week. We won't be sharing articles every week, but you should continue to find and annotate research articles as the semester goes on. Each week you should be finding a research article and turning in an annotation to Nick. The idea is that you will accumulate a collection of articles that can help you in your group/individual speeches.

Wednesday some of you shared your articles. We learned about many topics including MIS, healthy eating, generators, concussions in sports, the social stigma of mental illnesses, and a few others.

Note that this semester the assignment for campus engagements has changed! You will not need to attend 5 different campus engagements this semester like last semester. Instead, you will be required to engage in a cause, organization, event, or club within the UNI or Cedar Valley community.  This engagement will result in a reflective component using a common prompt. In 500-750 words you will describe the organization, cause, club, or event with which you were involved and why you chose it.  Explain your role and evaluate your level of engagement with the group by providing specific evidence. What impact did this experience have on you over the course of the semester?

This isn't due until the end of the semester so e-mail me if you have any questions. The idea is to write one well structured/written paper as opposed to 5 smaller ones. So for example, do you volunteer for the dance marathon committee? cool! now write a paper about it. (This is out of my hands so just do your best. Nick and I had nothing to do with this). I will add a link to another post once I get that up and running.

Homework for Friday: 
You should print of a research article for Friday. Any RECENT article regarding a potential topic for your individual speech or your group speech. If you don't know for sure what your topics are yet it's totally fine to bring an article regarding a potential topic. You will also need to provide an annotation. What does this mean? So alongside your PRINTED off article, you will need to create a word document. In that word document, you will have your annotation. This should include where the article came from, why it's credible, what it covers (an abstract), and any quote(s) you can pull directly from the article that stands out. So in other words, the exact same homework as before :)
