Today was Nicks Birthday so we were able to surprise him with a card and candy!

After that, we had two separate speeches, as is tradition. Ashton started with a speech about PTSD. Jesse followed up with a presentation about the pressures to attend a good college, and how that mindset dominates in California.

After the speeches, we took a few minutes to clarify the check plus system for this semester. This semester, check plusses are not necessary. If you have some/earn some. Then great! That will help your grade. But don't feel obligated like last year. Hopefully, this eases some of your minds!

Don't forget about your group speeches! Also, don't forget about your campus engagement for this month. Click this link to find out more if you forgot.
