Today we started by discussing one of the pillars of storytelling, chaos. We talked about denouement which is defined on dictionary.com as "the final resolution of the intricacies of a plot, as of a drama or novel.". Almost every story you encounter in any medium will have chaos somewhere within it. Who would read a story with no conflict right? In Ishmael, chaos takes the form of Ishmael discussing the state of the world we live in.

"Trial and error isn't a bad way to learn how to build an aircraft, but it can be a disastrous way to learn how to build a civilization" (pg. 110).

To further study chaos, we watched part of season 1 episode 5 of Louie (which is available on Netflix). Everyone then did a short writing assignment where you make a sentence, and bend it toward chaos in a short story that follows (about a paragraph). Similar to the "Halloween was everywhere" exercise.

Your homework for Friday is the following!
read the following section from Ishmael by Daniel Quinn: 
- The third quarter of the text (pg. 151-207) 

and the following from Calvin and Hobbes: 
- Rosalyn v Stupendous Man (pg. 85-91) 
- Environmentalism (pg. 92-93)

Shoutout to everyone who made it out to the TWLOHA fundraiser and hung out with me. Check out this sweet picture of two prairie dogs kissing that I bought!
