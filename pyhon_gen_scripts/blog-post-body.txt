If you plan on dropping a class for whatever reason, know that it must be done by October 28! That's the last day to drop a semester course without receiving an "F". It shows up as a "W" on your transcript (which is much better). ALSO: Don't think that you can just stop going to said class in order to drop it (I've heard of people making this mistake). There is a process to actually dropping classes, and I'm more than happy to help you do it! You can do it completely through myUniverse and if you need help, e-mail me and we'll get it figured out.

Now that that's out of the way! Today in class we started with a short writing assignment where everyone wrote about character (and voice). Answering questions such as "How have you created the character you have now?" and "What do you suspect people think of your character?". As part of the writing assignment, everyone created a fictional character which you'll use Wednesday. We then watched a clip from Season 02 Episode 02 of Louie on Netflix and discussed how the characters develop within the short segment we watched.

Homework for Friday: 
read Harvey by Mary Chase (the whole thing)

and the following from Calvin and Hobbes:
- Binoculars (pg. 79-84)
- Recess and Sports (pg. 120-129)

as always have the readings done Wednesday and complete your rundowns by Friday. We'll be doing audio rundowns again this week! The week after we'll go back to written ones.

I now have a list of documentaries you can watch to replace a day you missed so look for that on the homepage! Also next time I'm going to be going over how to register for classes, so stay tuned for that!
