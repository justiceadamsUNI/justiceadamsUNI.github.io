Hello fellow humans, today in class we started by reading The Raven by Edgar Allan Poe. Or rather, we listened to nick read it. We then talked about the momentum within the story, and how it still holds up. After that, we broke into small groups to discuss Ishmael. It seems that some people are getting frustrated with its repetitive nature, but just power through it! More than anything, even if you've fallen behind, make sure to read chapter 9 of Ishmael!

On Monday, November 7th, there will be an art exhibit/fundraiser/open mic and I'll be taking a group. This would be an awesome way to knock out a campus engagement, as well as get a check plus in the process! It starts at 6:30, and it should be a good time. You should come.

For your audio rundowns this week make sure that you read a piece of fiction. It can be a poem, song, paragraph, short story, etc. The idea is you record ~5,6 takes reading the piece of fiction while adjusting your delivery each time. Then pick your favorite rendition and turn it in with your audio rundowns. Nothing will help you more on your delivery than actually hearing yourself speak. This works best if it's just attached to the end of the audio file. Here's me reading one of my favorite poems from The Hobbit. Hopefully, this points you in the right direction.
