We spent this class discussing the stories from Pretty Monsters as well as Calvin and Hobbes. We once more used the point-and-read method throughout class. It was good to see some of you at Final Thursday last week! Hopefully you all had a good time. As we read portions of the book Nick played some Ethiopian jazz in the background. It was so lit. Also, I feel obligated to remind you that if you find a bug on the website report it and you get candy. Or candy-corn if you're into that.

Here's the readings for next week. Note that we are no longer reading from Pretty Monsters and are now Reading from The Night in Question by Tobias Wolf.
