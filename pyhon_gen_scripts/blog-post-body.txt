Today we continued on with pop speeches. It was pretty great to hear you all give your random speeches. We had topics including scars, chocolate, string cheese, astronomy, and of course youth football. It looks like we only have about 5 speeches to go so expect a really short class next time. You're so close to the finish line! (for this semester).

Anyway, here's some reminders of the things you should get done before the semester ends (Since there isn't any formal homework left).

- You need 5 campus engagements due by the end of the semester. You can e-mail me if you need to know how many you still need to do.

- Your final paper making an argument for your grade is due at the end of the semester. The final paper consist of you defending your grade. Make a case for why you deserve whatever grade you think you've earned. As you know, we don't like length restrictions in our class, so just give a well thought out argument for why you deserved whatever grade you think you've earned. Consider your class attendance, contribution to class discussion, how many rundowns you've turned in, check plusses earned, and campus engagements turned in. You can always e-mail me if you have questions!

I plan on sending you guys some info regarding the scholarship app over break, as well as some info regarding finals week (things like rod library extended hours, and destresser events). Don't worry, finals will be over before you know it.
