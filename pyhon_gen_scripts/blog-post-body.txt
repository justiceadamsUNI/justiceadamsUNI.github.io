Today we went over the concept of exigency and how it relates to our favorite stories. Exigency is defined by dictionary.com as "a case or situation that demands prompt action or remedy; emergency:". The class started by listing their favorite stories, then everyone split into small groups and if a group had listed the same story on more than one all time favorite list, it got written on the board. We eventually compiled a list of everyone's favorite stories including Lord Of The Rings (Woot Woot), Game Of Thrones, The Blindside, Harry Potter, American Horror Story, and more. From there the question was raised, "What do these stories have in common?". It turns out that almost everyone's favorite stories included some combination of the following topics : Death, War, Murder, Dead Parents, Terminal illness, and Romantic love. Each of these topics weighs quite heavy for the reader/viewer. Apparently, we really like dark/violent stuff, who knew! Nick then pointed out a specific film, in particular, The Dark Night, and focused on the one particular scene below (it's somewhat low quality, and has some weird edits but it's the best I could find).


This science places the viewer in an uncomfortable position where they must decide for themselves who should die (the prisoners, of the civilians). It's deep man. Keep in mind I'm paraphrasing Nicks Lesson. He does it way better than me!

For Wednesday remember that class is in the Commons! It is located by 23rd street market. Check your e-mails for a google maps link I sent out. Here's a picture of the place.


 Please print the following 4 documents and bring them to class Wednesday. The last one is an activity you should complete (it takes like 5 minutes).

Homework for this week: NONE. No readings/rundown this week because of the funky schedule. We'll get back into the groove next week.

If you read all the way to the bottom of this post, then bless your soul. You've earned a kick ass puppy gif.
