Hello my kin. I will be holding more office hours for the next few weeks as you all work on your group projects. Feel free to stop by if you need any help with your individual and/or group projects. Feel free to come as groups if that makes things easier.

As always I will be having my usual office hours on Tuesday and Thursday, now from 6-7pm. Also on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday I will now be doing office hours from 10-11AM. Feel free to stop by! If these times don't work for you, but you still wish to come feel free to drop me an E-mail. I'm sure I can make some time :)

Hope to see some of you there!
