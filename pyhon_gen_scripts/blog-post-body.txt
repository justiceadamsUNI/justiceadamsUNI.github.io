This semester, campus engagements will be operating a little differently! You will not need to attend 5 different campus engagements this semester. Instead, you will be required to engage in a cause, organization, event, or club within the UNI or Cedar Valley community. This engagement will result in a reflective component using a common prompt. In 500-750 words you will describe the organization, cause, club, or event with which you were involved and why you chose it. Explain your role and evaluate your level of engagement with the group by providing specific evidence. What impact did this experience have on you over the course of the semester?

This isn't due until the end of the semester so e-mail me if you have any questions. The idea is to write one well structured/written paper as opposed to 5 smaller ones. So for example, do you volunteer for the dance marathon committee? cool! now write a paper about it. (This is out of my hands so just do your best. Nick and I had nothing to do with this). Even though you no longer have to attend 5 campus engagements this semester, I will still continue to update the events page, as I find it valuable that you have access to information for any on campus events!
