Hey guys, Focus on Brazil: The Economic Effect from the Olympics is an event taking place this Wednesday! I highly encourage you all to attend if you still need to turn in campus engagements for the semester. Only two weeks left! It takes place on Wednesday from 4:30 PM - 6:00 PM. Learn about Brazil, their Economy, and try FREE authentic Brazillian Food.


I won't be able to make it until later so I won't be leading a group this time (I work until 5pm every day :( ). I hope to see you there if I can make it.
