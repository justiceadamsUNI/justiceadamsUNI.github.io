Today Nick went over Google Scholar, another resource you can use in your research projects. I highly recommend you play around with the search engine and see what you can find. After going over Google Scholar the class started sharing their articles/annotations. Each person got up in front of the class and shared their article. Sort of like the pop speeches you did last semester. You will continue this process of finding and annotating research articles for the rest of the semester.

Homework for Friday: 
It should be the same homework as last week, but I'd wait till next Wednesday and we'll discuss it!
