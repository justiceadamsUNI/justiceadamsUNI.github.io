Today Nick opened the class with a plug for a talk given by The Cedar Valley Refugee and Immigrant Residents. It took place today at 5pm in the Library! We then spent a great deal of time discussing what the term "core competency" means. The definition from --Investopedia-- is "Core competencies are the main strengths or strategic advantages of a business, including the combination of pooled knowledge and technical capacities that allow a business to be competitive in the marketplace."

Nick explained that our goal throughout the semester is to build your core competencies to include writing, speaking, and talking in front of a room. Having the ability to be able to talk in front of a room can help you drastically in your scholastic and professional careers. This lead to a discussion on proficiency vs growth in the education system.

So far the feedback we have received regarding the spring semester has been good. If you have anything else you feel would help, please let Nick or I know!

We then spent the rest of the class sharing research articles!

This Friday will be dedicated to your group projects. You will be spending the class period working with your groups and Nick and I will be walking around assisting you.

--Here-- is a signup sheet for your individual speeches. We will be doing individual speeches up until the first week of April. After that, we will be neck deep in group speeches hopefully. Feel free to sign up on the list, but remember that we're only doing two people per class period. So if you see 2 people have already claimed a day.

Homework for Wednesday: Bring your two research articles and be prepared to share them!
