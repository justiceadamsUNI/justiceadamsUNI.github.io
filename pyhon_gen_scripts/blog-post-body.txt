HOLA, Tuesday There will be another open mic event and another opportunity for you to earn a check plus! After yet another name change, the Neighborhood Roadshow will take place April 11th at 7 pm in the Great Reading Room of Seerly Hall. If you went to the last open mic, it's the same location.

I will be meeting people at my office hours at around 6:50 and we'll walk over from there! All of this information will be tweeted/e-mailed/yelled at you in class.

If you have any questions, e-mail me as always! I hope to see you all there!
