Yo! So today we went over Escape and how that relates to a story. Escape is essentially an invitation to invest in story worlds that aren't reality. Nick talked about this in great detail and even went over the escapism which is defined by dictionary.com as "the avoidance of reality by absorption of the mind in entertainment or in an imaginative situation, activity, etc.". Escape is one of the most powerful pillars within a narrative, just look at the current trend of superhero movies. We proceeded to watch a portion of the movie Wall-E and discuss how escapism works within it.

This week you will be turning in an audio rundown. We talked about this in class a bit. Here's a video explaining how to do your audio rundowns (from a technology standpoint). I go over how to record and send your audio rundowns via
- Android phones (0:00)
- I phones (2:02)
- Windows PC's (2:39)
- Apple PC's (3:55)

feel free to skip to the portion of the video you want. Here's one of my old rundows for reference. You don't need to talk for this long.


Try to continue to pull examples from the text as you would with a written rundown. Do not say you're confused! Saying you're confused about a story is really just a stopping point for your mind. You aren't confused, you just haven't processed it enough yet :). If you are stuck, come to office hours!
