Monday in class we spent all of our time in class discussing Ishmael. Going over questions such as 
"Does Ishmael think the narrator is a success? Do you?"
"Will Ishmaels plan to save the world prevail?"
"What is the premise of our story in the classroom?"

We discussed these questions as a group. Nick used to do this in exam form but this works better.
After a lengthy discussion of Ishmael, Nick and I started dispersing information regarding your second-semester projects. You will each do individual speeches as well as group speeches in the spring semester. Nick and I are going to figure out how we want the group structures to work and we'll let you know before the semester is over. If you have any questions at this point, feel free to e-mail me!

Your homework for Friday is the following!
read the following section from Ishmael by Daniel Quinn: 
-The fourth quarter of Ishmael up until the end of the book (pg. 211-263)

and the following from Calvin and Hobbes:
-Academia (pg. 175-192)
-Bill Waterson (pg. 207)

If you went to the taste of culture event make sure to write up an engagement to get credit for it! For the rest of the semester feel free to decide whether you want to turn in audio or written rundowns. It's up to you!

Finally, remember NO CLASS ON FRIDAY. Enjoy the break :)
