Welcome back from Spring Break. I hope everyone had a fun time. It was good to hear that some of you had a good time, but I still didn't get to ask a lot of you about your break. So I'll definitely be bugging you over the next few classes! Mine was alright I suppose. Pro tip:  Don't drive all the way to texas. Ever.

Anyway, today we spent the class listening to two different speeches. One on the importance of sleep, and one on the pros and cons of playing sports at a young age. Both speeches were exceptional so shout out to Didi and Brylee. As a class, we dissected the speeches and shared what worked and what didn't. The usual routine.

Class registration is upon us once more! You're practically done with your Freshman year, weird right? If you've forgotten how to register for classes, here's the video I made first-semester!

Also, April 11th is the next open mic reading! More on that later. Sorry for the short recap, but I suspect they will be this short for the rest of the year being that we are in "speech season". See you Wednesday!
