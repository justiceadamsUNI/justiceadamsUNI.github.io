Friday we started with another group speech. This time about providing water to impoverished nations by way of the Lifestraw! Hanna, Zach, Jack, Joselyn, and Brooke gave a wonderful presentation asking for funding to provide people in 3rd world countries with water. Everyone voted and agreed that they would fund their cause.

After that Nick took some time to remind people that you should e-mail your final essay to Nick, and also e-mail your campus engagement-reflection paper to me! I also will be sending out a reminder e-mail
