Hello there, tomorrow February 7th there will be a "Real Community Hot Mic Night". What is that you ask? Well, it's an open mic much like the Final Thursday or the TWLOHA events we've been to before. Nick will be reading and I'll be taking a group!

The event starts at 7 PM in the --Great Reading Room of Seerly Hall--. If you decide to go and write about your experience then you can earn a check plus! If you wish to go with me you should meet me on the second floor of the library at my OFFICE HOURS at approximately 6:50 PM. I'll be sending out all this information via e-mail as well.

I hope to see you all there!
