Wednesday was our final class before spring break! Hopefully, you all spent the break working on your speeches :)

If you need a reminder of what date your speech is due, check --Here--

Asiah started off our Wednesday class with her speech about Valentine's day. It was a terrific speech, so shoutout to Asiah.

After the speech, we discussed her strengths/weakness's as a class and voted on what grade we would give her. Everyone agreed it was an A-level speech.

We then spent the rest of the class deciding when the group speeches would take place. We came up with the following after a fun dice game. See below for the group dates by topic

April 17th - PTSD
April 19th - Hollow Homes
April 21st - Water
April 26th - Guns
April 28th - Seaworld

I hope you all had a good break and I'll see you on Monday!
