Today we started by finishing the bills on how to stop/fix underage drinking. This is also what you guys did last Friday. Sorry for not having a recap on Friday, I had to miss class.

Anyway, after the last group shared their bill we had a pretty lengthy discussion on whether or not 18 is the actual age of adulthood and what that meant. Some argued that at 18 you can go and sign up for the army/smoke cigarettes so why shouldn't you be able to drink. Others proposed the age of 19 for a legal drinking age, and some even argued that it's fine at 21. It was interesting to hear all of your ideas and we then voted on which bills would make a good foundation if we were to go forward. Remember that alcohol was illegal for 12 years and spawned a criminal empire.

This discussion followed with us thinking about the association between drinking and smoking cigarettes. Smoking is not advertised and has the more negative social stigma, yet it's available to people at the age of 18. It's an interesting dynamic society has created. What's more frowned upon? Drinking or smoking? As a class, we decided that for the most part smoking carries a more negative connotation.

We officially have everyone signed up for individual speeches so don't forget your date. Also, next time we will be signing you up for your group speech dates so stay tuned!

Sorry for the late recap. I got swamped Monday with a project I had to code.
