Today we started by reviewing the pillars, which if you can't remember are:
-Belief
-Exigency
-Schema
-Escapism
-Character
-Voice
-Deconstruction
-Universal Appeal
-Chaos
-Momentum
-Deflection

Nick then read a piece that he wrote and we talked about how he used the pillars to develop this piece. You all answered questions like "what pillars are prevalent?" and "why did Nick use said pillar the way he did?"

The idea is that when building your individual and group speeches you should try to use every pillar and aggregate them together to form a type of synergy. Your speeches will be much better if you develop them with this in mind! Throughout the semester we will probably start referring to the pillars as "lenses". The words are interchangeable.

After having an odd conversation about sex and porn, you all started writing a story with a character that has a goal. The objective is to write this story using the pillars. You all get a week to work on this, as we will share them on Friday!

Homework: For Friday, like I said above, write your story about your character to the best of your ability and be prepared to share it with the class. If you write a really good piece and you print it off and turn it into Nick, you can get a check-plus out of the ordeal! For Monday, print off a research article and have an annotation ready to turn in! From now on, Mondays will be the days for you all to turn in an annotation, this way we can discuss it as a group through the week.

Finally, if you set up a WeChat group like we talked about in class, don't forget to show Nick to get that check plus!
