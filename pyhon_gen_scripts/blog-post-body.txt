Today we started with listing some of our favorite stories (If Lord of The Rings wasn't on your list you're wrong), and kept the list in the back of our minds for a later discussion on "who owns the meaning of the story? The author or reader?" We discussed how education primarily teaches us that it's the author who determines the meaning, yet the meaning of a story depends greatly on the context of who reads it. (I'm paraphrasing Nicks lesson, and it was a bit rushed so I'm sorry if it's less than ideal). It became clear that there isn't a singular truth/meaning to a given story, and that they can be interpreted many different ways. We will probably talk more about this at a later date, and no doubt we'll refer back to our favorite story list. We also carved out some time today to finish watching Inside Man(S01 E04) and discuss whether we liked it. Turns out everyone liked the episode.

Homework for Friday: read the following stories from the book The Best American Nonrequired Reading 2015 (That book you got over the summer). You will also be required to do your first weekly rundown. Try to reflect upon each story individually, and think about what worked/didn't work. You should avoid summarizing the story, as we all know how the stories play out. Instead, focus on your thoughts. In other words don't summarize the story, summarize your thoughts/feelings.

NEXT TIME WE WILL BE GOING TO A PLAY

Next class, we will all go to Strayer-Wood theater for the entirety of the class. This means you will not need to go to lang hall, instead go directly to Strayer-Wood for class. You do not need to do anything else but walk straight in since you're a cornerstone student. I will be posted up outside the doors to the auditorium until the play starts so just look for me. The play will be a theater adaption of "Wear areas" (pg. 115) and "You are in the dark, in the car" (pg. 139). About the play: "The show, which was largely created through the experiences of the actors, addresses many ideas but primarily centers around violence towards the body and the effect that has on the mind and on our own culture". 

Strayer-Wood is across from Redecker Center and is located next to the art gallery. I will attach a link via google maps below. See you there.
