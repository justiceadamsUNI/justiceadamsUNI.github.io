Today we had our first individual speech! Shout out to Jack who nailed his speech on sabermetrics, "the application of statistical analysis to baseball records". After Jack gave his speech we all got an opportunity to say what worked and didn't work in Jacks speech (spoiler: pretty much everything worked).

After the speech, Nick read his story "What are you laughing at" about children with disabilities. After writing for a few minutes about your thoughts, you all then divided into groups and discussed the story. It seemed like most of you guys liked the story, so that was good. Nick announced as you guys were leaving that if you wanted extra credit you could e-mail him for the story and do a rundown-like write up of it. This would be an easy way for a check plus. Hopefully, I can get the PDF from him so I can post it here! -- this isn't done yet--

Anyway, Next time we will be doing pop speeches on teenage drinking. This is to get you all in front of the classroom once more before your speeches roll around. You'll be working in groups and trying to come up with a solution/alternative to underage drinking.
