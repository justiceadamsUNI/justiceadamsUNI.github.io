Today we talked about registering for classes for the first 15 minutes of class. I will soon be sending out an e-mail with the relevant information as well as creating a new post on the website dedicated to registering for classes as well as advising holds. So keep an eye or your e-mail!

When everyone wasn't picking on me for my hawkeye shirt we spent the rest of the time discussing the bulk of Ishmael, and how it's viewpoints on mother culture made us think. This lead to quite a few different discussions which was awesome. We also decided that you can watch Life After People on history.com for extra credit! I'll make sure to update the extra-credit documentary list.

Your homework is the following!
read the following section from Ishmael by Daniel Quinn: 
- The second quarter of the text (pg. 151-207)

and the following from Calvin and Hobbes: 
- Rosalyn v Stupendous Man (pg. 85-91) 
- Environmentalism (pg. 92-93) 


Don't forget that the upcoming Monday, November 7th, there will be an art exhibit/fundraiser/open mic and I'll be taking a group. This would be an awesome way to knock out a campus engagement, as well as get a check plus in the process! It starts at 6:30, and it should be a good time. You should come.
