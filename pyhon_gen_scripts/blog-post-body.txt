Today we started class with a speech on climate change. It was interesting to hear Kai give his speech with sources from NASA and the EPA. After Kai gave his speech we provided him with our feedback. This was actually our only speech today. Luckily that opened the window for us to have enough time to get back to Jacob which we talked about before.

Jacob was able to give us additional facts regarding youth football concussions and everyone agreed that his argument was far more persuasive given this additional information.

Plug Party: This week is Sexual Assault Awareness Week hosted by Sig Ep. Jacob L from class plugged the fundraising events and their out raising money for a good cause. Feel free to check out this poster with Sexual Assault Awareness Week information. Or check out their twitter feed at @SigEpUNI

Also don't forget about the Neighborhood Roadshow tomorrow. An open mic event which you should all come to. And another opportunity for a check plus. I'll be taking a group, more on that --Here-- !
