Today we started by discussing Kurt Vonnegut's 'Long Walk to Forever'. It's a pretty great short story so if you haven't read it then you totally should.

We then continued our tradition of everyone sharing their individual articles for this week. It was interesting to hear more about your guy's research, things like
- Heart conditions
- Earthquake resistant interior design
- Water reservation
- Solar panel roofing

and so much more!

Sorry for the super late class recap! I've been absolutely swamped this week with test and homework. I'll try not to let it happen again :)
