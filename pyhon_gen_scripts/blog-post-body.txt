Today we started by doing instructor evaluations. I know that all of you mentioned me as the best thing to ever happen to you in the comments portion. It's OK guys, I get it.

After evaluations, we finally started with group speeches! Lexi, Jacob L, Jacob T, and Hailey started us off with a great speech about PTSD. Meanwhile, Nick passed out some of his birthday candy. After this, we took some time to deconstruct their speech and give them feedback. Hopefully, you all are thinking about your speeches as they approach rapidly. Let us know if you need help!
