Today after a long debate we decided to have class outside. It was actually pretty warm out, so I was wrong this one time. Nick sent out a prompt and everyone spent the first 25 minutes of class writing out responses to the various questions. Some of the key questions were
- Do you like valentines day?
- How goes the semester?
- How is the group project going?

and so on. Nick collected these at the end so he could get a could feel of where people were at. Anyway, after 25 minutes everyone met up on top of the union to discuss our responses and talk about valentines day from a deconstructive point of view. We spent a decent amount of time discussing why some of you hate and why some of you love valentines day.

Jacob Levang then gave a brief pitch for why you should vote for him for Student Government. You can all vote for student government president through my universe, but Jacob is running to be a representative of the college of business. If you are in the business college, vote for Jacob! Do it!

We then wrapped up the class talking about the student government which lead to a discussion on how it's rather easy to skew statistics. I can vouch for this as well and I encourage you all to take an entry level statistics course. I think statistics and combinatorics can prove to be two of the most useful branches of mathematics.
