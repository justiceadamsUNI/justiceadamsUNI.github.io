Today we starting by talking about politics! Nick talked about citizens united, and how they drastically changed the way presidential campaigns can receive funding. After that, we went outside to discuss the stories of the week within our small groups. On Friday we will continue discussing these stories so make sure you have them read. For next week the reading schedule says to read some stories from Welcome To The Monkey House, but since we won't have regular class next Wednesday (We'll go to a seminar about personal wellness) you aren't going to have to read anything for next week. Instead, we will push back Welcome To The Monkey House until the spring semester. I'll e-mail you all of this info later next week.

Anyway make sure you have read the following stories, and have them included in your rundown by Friday:

read the following stories from We Live in Water by Jess Walter: 
- Anything Helps (pg. 1) 
- Thief (pg. 41)   <-- Hence the sweet image for the post.
- Helpless Little Things (pg. 69) 
- The Wolf and the Wild (pg. 133) 

and the following sections from Calvin and Hobbes: 
- Cast and Intro (pages 6-31) 
- Guilt and Hobbes (pages 32-35)

Sorry for the late recap post, one of the technologies I use (Github) for making this site possible kind of shit the bed on me :(. That is all kiddos, carry on.
