Today we started by splitting into small groups and discussing the 5 stories that we read for this week. After dispersing for a while we returned to the class room and wrote on the board the number of people who dislike/liked each story. We then made a circle around the classroom and discussed the stories as a class. This will be a common occurence during the entire year. Hopefully you all have a good weekend and remember there's no class on Monday as it's a holiday!!

Homework for next week: Read the following stories. Remember to work on your rundown as well. (Read the stories by Wednesday. Rundown due Friday). Two of the stories will be emailed to you whie the rest come from The Best American Nonrequired Reading 2015.

- Chainsaw Fingers (pg. 309)
- 780 Days of Solitude (pg. 41)
- Who Wants to Shoot an Elephant (pg. 1)
- Thank You Esther Forbes (PDF via E-mail)
- The Red Bow (PDF via E-mail)

Hopeully I'll be able to pick a campus event next week and we can go as a group (for those who want to go) so I'll let you know what happens!
