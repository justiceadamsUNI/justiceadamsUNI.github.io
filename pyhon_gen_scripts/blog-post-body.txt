Wednesday in class we won't be having regular class! (oh joy...). Yes, we will have class in the commons yet again! This time for a discussion with the author Paul Crenshaw (The guy who wrote Chainsaw Fingers). You should report to the commons for class, and make sure you actually attend this one because they are making me take attendance! I'll be walking around somewhere in the back of the room, so you can't miss me. Nick and I decided that you are more than welcome to use this as a campus engagement, so with that being said, it's kind of a group engagement now.

There will also be a longer more general discussion that's open to the public Wednesday night from 7-9pm. This particular evening event isn't required, but you are more than welcome to use it as a campus engagement as well.

Finally, Thursday morning there will be a breakfast with the author. It's open to anybody and will take place in the peer mentor space on the sun porch in the library. There will be coffee and light breakfast items from 8-9 am. All are welcome and encouraged to attend. Let me know if you have any questions! Also, here's a --Link-- To the commons if you forgot where it's at!
