Again today everyone spent the entire class sharing their research article for this week. Some of the research articles were about spanking kids, teachers salaries, and PTSD. We spent a good amount of time discussing the LifeStraw as well. The reason you guys share your articles is to get some informal speaking experience. The idea is that this will help you with your speeches for this semester. We will only do this for a couple more weeks, however, so be prepared yo share your articles each Monday and Wednesday! If everyone shares their piece in time, you guys will be able to leave early on Wednesday.

Next Tuesday there will be an opportunity for a check plus. February 7th there will be an open mic night in Seerley Hall. This will operate much like the Final-Thursday's and The TWLOHA event we went to a while back (in fact it will be the exact same for the most part). The show is titled "Real Community Hot Mic Night" and takes place at 7 pm in the Great Reading Room of Seerley Hall. Nick will be reading, and I will be organizing a group. You should come! I'll let you guys know more soon!

Also just keep in mind that next Wednesday is a student services session. I will send out an e-mail early next week (Probably Monday) with the documents you will need. I will also print off some extras, but one needs to be filled out before the presentation.

Homework: For this Friday, finish your story about your character to the best of your ability and be prepared to share it with the class (we started these last Friday). If you write a really good piece and you print it off and turn it into Nick, you can get a check-plus out of the ordeal! The story should be about a character striving for a goal. Also be prepared to do group work with your squad.
