Once again we had two more speeches today. Sophie gave a well thought out speech regarding acne and what the actual causes of acne are. I think everyone learned quite a bit about the formation and treatment of acne.

Joselyn then followed up with a speech about life on a cruise ship. It was interesting to see her primary research work as she conducted interviews over spring break.

A week from the upcoming Tuesday will be the next open mic. I'll keep you posted! Have a good weekend kiddos.
