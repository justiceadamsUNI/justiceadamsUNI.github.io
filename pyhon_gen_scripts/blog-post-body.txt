Today in class I ruled with an Iron Fist, as nick was out sick.


First I went over how to register for cornerstone for next semester, as I  got a few questions. If you ever forget refer to the Youtube video below! It should be relatively simple.

After that, I showed everyone how to find when their finals take place. Don't sleep on your finals guys, they'll be here before you know it and being prepared is a big part of the battle. After you come back from Thanksgiving break there will be only 2 weeks before finals. You simply find your class section on the web page below and find when the final for that section take place. Just remember to round down for class times that don't start on the hour! (Example: If you have class M,W,F at 9:30am then you would locate the M,W,F at 9:00am portion of the table to find your final).

As always if you have questions e-mail me!

Everyone then split into 4 groups and chose a discussion question to go over within the groups. Hopefully, you all enjoyed reading Ishmael as much as I did when I was a freshman! If you still haven't turned in your rundown you can still turn in an audio rundown by Friday. Here's the reading list

Your homework for Friday is the following
read the following section from Ishmael by Daniel Quinn: 
-The fourth quarter of Ishmael up until the end of the book (pg. 211-263)

and the following from Calvin and Hobbes:
-Academia (pg. 175-192)
-Bill Waterson (pg. 207)

Finally, remember NO CLASS ON FRIDAY. I won't see you guys again for a while so have a good Thanksgiving! Enjoy the break :)
