If you miss a day of class for whatever reason, you can watch one of the following documentaries to recover the points you missed. Please note this is not endless and it will only work 1 or 2 times per semester. Nick won't allow you to skip a ton of classes and replace all the points via documentary watching. Each documentary has some learning value, or will force you to think deconstructively so keep that in mind! Treat it like a rundown. Talk about what you liked, draw examples from the film to use in the write-up, talk about your reaction, etc. After watching the film type up a document much like a rundown and turn it into Nick + e-mail it to me. Also make sure to put what date you missed within the first few sentences so nick can take note (ex: "I missed Monday 10/10 due to a wedding, so I decided to watch X film..."). Anywhere here is the list of documentaries. All are available by streaming via Netflix unless noted otherwise:

- Virginia
- Stripped
- Dear Mr. Watterson
- Particle Fever
- The Wolfpack
- City 40
- The City Dark
- Tiny
- American Movie (Not available on Netflix. E-mail me if you need it)
- Making a Murderer
- Living with the Machigenga (Not available on Netflix. E-mail me if you need it).
- First Contact: Lost Tribe of the Amazon

Talk to me in class if you ever need this list again!
