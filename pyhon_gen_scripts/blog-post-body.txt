Today was the first day back from Thanksgiving break. It was good to see you all again and I hope your break went well. Stay strong my brethren. Christmas break will soon be upon us. Today we started by having every student create a list of the pillars they could remember (The narrative pillars we've been talking about all semester: Exigency, Voice, Schema, Momentum, Deflection...). After everyone created their individual list of each pillar we split into groups and each group compiled a 'master' list of the pillars with their group members. Groups were asked to mark which lesson the given pillars were talked about and then each group summarized two different pillars in front of the class. This was a great way to refresh everyone's memory regarding the narrative pillars as we move towards your group speeches. Although we didn't quite finish, Wednesday we will continue where we left off.

For Wednesday there are no readings, but you should compile a few sentences on what you think your grade is so far as we approach the end of the semester. This will help with your final paper where you defend your grade. Just write a couple sentences about what you think you've earned and why. Be prepared to turn it in next class. I will soon be talking to you guys about the UNI scholarship application (I'll let you know more at a later date).

Also, be sure to check the website tomorrow for a post about an event taking place Wednesday called "Focus on Brazil: The Economic Effect from the Olympics". It would be a great campus engagement :)
