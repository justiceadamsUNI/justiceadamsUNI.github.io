Today we spent the entirety of the class touring the library. This will help you during your research projects and all the information can help you throughout your college career. We went over where everything is at in the library, what helps with research, and plenty of services offered at Rod Library.

It was a relatively light class, as this is all we did today. Everyone also turned in this week's article annotation, so if you didn't, make sure to bring it Monday. For more information on the wonderful Rod Library, here's their website. Don't forget almost everything is at no cost to you!
