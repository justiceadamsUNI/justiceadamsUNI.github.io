Friday we started with going over all the short stories for the week. It appeared that Escape from Spiderhead was questionably received. We then discussed some of the real-world prison studies that have taken place in the past. If you're feeling adventurous google 'Stanford prison experiment". Here's the Wikipedia page for the interested. Remember that campus engagements are due by the end of the semester. They should be (1, 2) pages long. That means 1 page< length <2 pages. Next week I'll try to set up a group engagement to go to. I totally forgot to this week (my bad). Next week we'll be reading from Harvey by Mary Chase (It's a playwright). Here's your homework!

Homework for Friday: 
read Harvey by Mary Chase (the whole thing)

and the following from Calvin and Hobbes:
- Binoculars (pg. 79-84)
- Recess and Sports (pg. 120-129)

as always have the readings done Wednesday and complete your rundowns by Friday. We'll be doing audio rundowns again this week! The week after we'll go back to written ones.
