First off, I sent out a Google Doc on Monday so that you guys can sign up for your individual speeches. It seems to be working and already a few of you guys have signed up! You have until the end of the first week of April to give your individual speech. Just open the doc and find whichever date you wish to give your speech, then add your name to the bulleted list. Please keep in mind we're only doing 2 speeches a day, so if you see that two people are already signed up for a given day please pick another date! You can find the link to the doc --Here-- 

With today's nicer weather we decided once more to take the class outside. After going outside you all spent the first few minutes of the class thinking about what makes an A level speech. After doing some thinking on your own we split you guys into groups and every group dispersed to accumulate thoughts on what makes an A level speech. 

At the 25 minute mark, we all congregated on top of the union discussed what you guys came up with. Some of the things we decided that make up an A level speech include
- confidence
- eye contact
- preparedness
- light visuals

and more. Some of you guys shared some interesting techniques for speech giving that we discussed further as a group as well. This discussion lead right into the group talking about what makes an A for the semester. You all should have no problem getting an A in the course. Nick likes to let the learning come naturally. If you show up, put forth an effort, and engage in the content each class, no doubt you will learn a great deal and it will show. As some of you stated during the conversation you have to try not to get an A in the course.

Hopefully, this info will help you as we rapidly approach group and individual speeches! Friday you will be spending the entire class working in your groups (probably in the Library). Nick and I will be floating around assisting you all. You can hold on to your two annotations for now and we'll collect them on Friday as well!
