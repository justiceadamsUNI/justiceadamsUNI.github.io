Today we started discussing the stories we read in small groups. We also voted on the board on which stories we liked. Next week we will start reading stories from the collection We Live in Water by Jess Walter, so make sure you have the book. Later on, Nick clarified that the checks system has been removed from the syllabus. This means you should only have to worry about the CHECK PLUS system in place when writing your rundowns!

Nick also talked a bit about deflection in stories, and how you should keep it in the back of your mind going forward (More on this later). Also whenever you cite a source within your weekly rundown you should definitely cite the source at the bottom. Always include a works-cited page, if outside sources were used.

Homework for Friday: Complete your rundown, and reflect upon the following stories.

- Chainsaw Fingers (pg. 309)
- 780 Days of Solitude (pg. 41)
- Who Wants to Shoot an Elephant (pg. 1)
- Thank You Esther Forbes (PDF via E-mail)
- The Red Bow (PDF via E-mail)

ALSO: Try to do Letter to My Grandnephew (pg. 68). There was some confusion about this, being that it was on the reading schedule, but you should try to include it within your rundown (it's like 3 pages long).

I'm trying to get a group together to go to the observatory visit tomorrow so check your e-mails! It's going to be a good time. This is also why I chose the very weird header image. Because it's light deflection, and we talked about deflection. Get it? God damn I'm good.
