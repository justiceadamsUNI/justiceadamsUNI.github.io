Wednesday we broke into groups and each group was assigned a segment of chapter 9 from Ishmael. Each group recapped their particular section and pulled quotes from the text in order to back up their analysis. This is basically all we did all class, and it was a relatively light day. We decided not to discuss the election results as a class, but we will soon I'm sure. Sorry for the short blog post, there isn't much more to add!

Your homework for Friday is the following!
read the following section from Ishmael by Daniel Quinn: 
- The third quarter of the text (pg. 151-207) 

and the following from Calvin and Hobbes: 
- Rosalyn v Stupendous Man (pg. 85-91) 
- Environmentalism (pg. 92-93)
