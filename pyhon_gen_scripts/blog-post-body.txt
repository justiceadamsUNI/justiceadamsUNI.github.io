Today we started off by giving Jacob his feedback on his suicide awareness speech from Monday since we ran out of time. After giving Jacob feedback we had two more.

First Brooke gave a speech about the benefits of volunteering outside of just the usual 'feel-good' aspect. Financial as well as career opportunities which can be furthered by volunteering.

After Brooke, we had a speech on homelessness in the united states. Both speeches were received really well! Don't forget that there will be an open mic event coming up, and I'll be taking a #squad.
