Hello all! Have a good break, enjoy your time off, and I'll see you when you get back!

A few things to adress: 
1.) You don't need to purchase any more books for second semester. You're good to go
2.) I'll be making a scholarship application walkthrough video over break and sending it out. We'll talk about it when you get back (It's important).
3.) Your grades for first semester are in the books! Go check out myUniverse to see how well you did.
4.) The campus events portion of the website will be offline until after break. As if any of you were going to spend your break going to campus engagements :)

Have a good christmas break kiddos.
