Today we started with an activity led by Lee. Lee has to go back to China pretty soon, around the time of the Chinese New Year so she had us all say "happy new year" in Mandarin while she recorded it. She'll show this to her students once she returns to China. From what I could gather, it's pronounced something like "Shing Ni-en Qui Loo". Forgive my Mandarin skills, that might not be entirely correct!

After the new years fun, each group was able to share their short stories. They were pretty amazing. We had stories about steroids, a pregnant girl, a Christmas story about a reindeer accidently stabbing Santa, and more. I enjoyed them quite a bit.

We then proceeded with your final project for the semester...pop speeches. Everyone in the class will be giving a pop speech based on completely random topics given by the class. So for example, let's say it was my turn to give a pop speech, and someone yelled out ramen noodles. I would then give my pop speech about the wonders of ramen noodles completely on the fly. Sorta like improv! This will help with any speech anxiety and better prepare you for your research speeches/group speeches in the spring semester. Once everyone gives a pop speech WE ARE DONE. Yup, you all get to go home. So if everyone goes Wednesday, then we won't even meet Friday. Nick and I will be providing periodic feedback on the pop speeches. Remember, we don't care if they're good right now, they're improv, it's more about the fact that you're doing it! (Mine probably wasn't good my freshman year...)

Anyway, here's some reminders of the things you should get done before the semester ends (Since there isn't any formal homework left).

- You need 5 campus engagements due by the end of the semester. You can e-mail me if you need to know how many you still need to do.

- Your final paper making an argument for your grade is due at the end of the semester. The final paper consist of you defending your grade. Make a case for why you deserve whatever grade you think you've earned. As you know, we don't like length restrictions in our class, so just give a well thought out argument for why you deserved whatever grade you think you've earned. Consider your class attendance, contribution to class discussion, how many rundowns you've turned in, check plusses earned, and campus engagements turned in. You can always e-mail me if you have questions!
