Friday we discussed the financial aid meeting that was held Wednesday. Adding to that - this is why I didn't do a class recap on Wednesday. It wasn't needed. Anyway, we discussed the meeting, what worked, what didn't, and then went over the opportunity cost of missing class. Turns out not many of you enjoyed the financial aid meeting. Shocker... After that, we went back to our usual routine and discussed the five stories from last week. Here's a sweet youtube video I found. It's a retelling of Bullet in the Brain - that story you read for Friday. I thought it was pretty neat! Anyway, here's your homework for next week.

Homework for Friday: 
read the following stories from Tenth of December by George Saunders:
- Escape from Spiderhead (pg. 45)
- Tenth of December (pg. 215)

and the following from Calvin and Hobbes:
- Rising Chaos (pg. 44)
- School Report (pg. 94-98)
- The strips on pages 42-4

as always complete your rundowns by Friday!

I'll try to get a group engagement together for this week, so I'll let you know fam. Next week your rundowns will probably be in audio form - we'll talk about this monday hopefully!
