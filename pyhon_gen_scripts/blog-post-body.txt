We continued today sharing article annotations in front of the class so I'll keep this guy relatively short. Today some of the topics you guys presented included
- Plastic pollution in water
- Homeless people
- Medical radiation and its effects
- Take out containers and making them biodegradable
- Optimism and Health

and so much more!

The reason we do this is so that you all can get experience giving speeches and learning to carry a room. You might not realize it, but you have given more speeches due to these article annotations than any of the other cornerstone classes. That experience matters and it can help you see what works and what doesn't. Hopefully, you can utilize this knowledge in your group speeches!

Also, If you wish to share your individual speech or group speech just let me or Nick know one class period ahead of time :)

Homework: Bring 2 research articles for next week! One to share plus one more. Same deal as always, if you have questions... email me!
