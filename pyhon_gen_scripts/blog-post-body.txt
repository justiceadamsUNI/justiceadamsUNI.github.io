Today in class we watched the Oscar-nominated Netflix movie "World Of Tomorrow". It was a short film that demonstrated the concept of exigency we talked about on Monday. After watching the film everyone took a few minutes to write about what they thought. The class then talked about whether we liked or disliked the short film as a class. It was an interesting short film and there were some mixed reactions from the class. Next week we will be back on the reading schedule.

Homework for next week:
read the following stories from Pretty Monsters by Kelly Link: 
- The Faery Handbag (pg. 24) 
- The Wizards of Perfil (pg. 46) 

and the following sections from Calvin and Hobbes: 
- Raccoon (pg. 37-41) 
- Licensing (pg. 147-149)
- Evolution and Television (pg. 161-165)

As always the readings should be completed by Wednesday, and your rundowns should be done by Friday.
