Monday we started by writing about the concept of lying. What do you lie about? How often do you lie? Does it work? What makes a good lie? I know all you little heathens do it.

We then played two truths and a lie, which is a game where you share 2 truths and 1 lie, and people try to guess which is the lie. I wasn't very good, but some of you were pretty convincing. This all ties back to the fact that every story requires a belief in lies, which nick talked about for a bit.

Homework for Wednesday:
read the following stories from Pretty Monsters by Kelly Link: 
- The Faery Handbag (pg. 139) 
- The Wizards of Perfil (pg. 27) 

and the following sections from Calvin and Hobbes: 
- Raccoon (pg. 37-41) 
- Licensing (pg. 147-149)
- Evolution and Television (pg. 161-165)

As always the readings should be completed by Wednesday, and your rundowns should be done by Friday.

This Thursday we will be getting a group together to go to the Final Thursday reading(9/29). We will meet outside lang hall at around 6:40 and then take off at around 6:45 (It's a ten-minute walk to get to the Hearst Center For the Arts). You should come. I'll send out another e-mail probably on Thursday morning, and I'll remind you Wednesday. If you forgot what to write up for campus engagements click here.

Also, go complete your MapWorks surveys at some point, I've been told this is very important. It should be in your e-mail. Just search your inbox for "mapworks".

Finally, Go follow the twitter page. Right now.

Sorry for the late post, I've been getting Pwn3d with test and papers this week.
