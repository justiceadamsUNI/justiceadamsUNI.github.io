After some technical difficulties involving an Elmo and a VGA cord, we had two speeches once again. Nolan gave a speech about losing weight and how to do so in a healthy manner. It was cool to hear his own story throughout his speech!

Jacob also gave a speech about concussions in youth football, something that rarely gets talked about. Most of the time when people discuss concussions in sports, youth football is overlooked in favor of collegiate or high school sports.

Here's a link to a post about registering for classes if anyone has forgotten how to do so! If you need any help registering, questions about classes, or anything else don't hesitate to e-mail me or ask me in class/office hours.

Have a good weekend!
