Wednesday in class we had Dylan give a speech on Lacrosse. Everyone learned a ton being that no one knows much about lacrosse. Lacrosse comes from the native Americans, who knew?

Later Savannah gave a speech on premature births, relating it to her life and her premature cousins. Both speeches received all A's from the class, so good work guys!

Shoutout to everyone who came out to the open mic event with me to support Nick. We were a bit low in numbers this time, but it was awesome none the less.

CHECK Your e-mails for info about Friday's class! It contains VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION! :)
