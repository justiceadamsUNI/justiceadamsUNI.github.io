Today we went to Strayer-Wood and watched a play about both "Wear areas" (pg. 115) and "You are in the dark, in the car" (pg. 139). It was an interesting experience, and took up the entire class time. Not much else to say here. Next time we'll discuss what we all thought about the required readings for this week (See below).

Homework for next class (Friday): read the following stories from the book The Best American Nonrequired Reading 2015 (That book you got over the summer). You will also be required to do your first weekly rundown.

- Wear areas (pg. 115)
- You are in the dark, in the car (pg. 139)
- The Contestant (pg. 76)
- Our Neighbors House (pg. 207) 
- Man from the south (PDF via e-mail)
