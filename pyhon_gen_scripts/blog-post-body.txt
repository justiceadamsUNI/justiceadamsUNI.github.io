Today Nick Started by reading a story about death from author Sheila Johnson. You can find that same short story here if you wish to re-read. You all spent some time discussing whether or not you liked the piece before we deconstructed it as a class. We also took the time to vote whether or not the class liked the postmodernism video we saw before (See previous class recap).

Nick then took the time to go over the assignment for Friday. We discussed research articles, and how to find them through the Rod Library website. Next time we'll go over google scholar, another great resource for you to use!

Homework for Friday: 
You should print of a research article for Friday. Any RECENT article regarding a potential topic for your individual speech or your group speech. If you don't know for sure what your topics are yet it's totally fine to bring an article regarding a potential topic. You will also need to provide an annotation. What does this mean? So alongside your PRINTED off article, you will need to create a word document. In that word document, you will have your annotation. This should include where the article came from, why it's credible, what it covers (an abstract), and any quotes you can pull directly from the article that stand out.

Here's an example. This is entirely made up.

- Article: Smokings Effect On Teenage Brain Development.

- Author: The author, John J. Smith, received his P.H.D. in Neurobiology from the university of Arkansas in 2011. Since then he has done significant research studying the effects of smoking and has already published multiple peer-reviewed articles. This article was also peer-reviewed and was published in the Medical Journal of Modern Medicine. John J. Smith provides accurate statistics that can be cross-referenced from the citations provided at the bottom of the article.

- Abstract: Over 100 people smoke worldwide. Smoking can cause various health issues, and although U.S. society has decreased in its amount of people who smoke, it still is a multi-hundred-dollar industry. This article examines the effects of smoking on minors, and more specifically how it can affect their brain development. After copious amounts of research, Neurobiologist John J. Smith concludes that smoking causes minors to turn into flesh-craving zombies.

- Quotes: 
"99.8% of smokers who were studied turned to zombies within 12 hours".
"A study in 2002 allowed Neuroscientist to concluded that Justice Adams is the sexiest man alive".
"Hodor" - Hodor.


Thus, you will turn in TWO documents together. Your article, and its annotation.
