Today in class we formed a circle within the classroom so we could all discuss our education based memories. This took up most of the class time, and was a great exercise for getting to know everyone. From garbage cans on fire to attempted assassinations via sharpie markers, it was super interesting to hear all of your stories. We didn't do much of anything else today.

Homework for next Wednesday: read the following stories from the book The Best American Nonrequired Reading 2015 (That book you got over the summer)

- The contestant (pg. 76)
- Our Neighbors house (pg. 207)
- Chainsaw Fingers (pg. 309)

After each story try to think about what worked and what didn't. Note that these readings are not due until next Wednesday. I'm sure you all have already made it through the entirety of your book over the summer, so you shouldn't even have to do it. ;)

We have figured out how campus engagements will work. Each semester you will have to do 5 campus engagements, and write a 1-2 page paper on your experience (Double spaced). Try to answer the following questions : Where was the event? What was the event? Why did you choose said event? How was your experience? Would you recommend it to others? Try to focus on the last two questions for a majority of your paper. You can e-mail it directly to me, or hand it to me in class. These are not meant to be difficult, so don't stress. Here are some examples of events you could count as campus engagements.

- Intramural sports games
- Plays
- Almost anything in Gallagher
- Club meetings (PLEASE GO TO CLUB MEETINGS)
- Art Exhibits

These are just a few examples, but there are TONS more not presented on the list. If you are wondering what counts as a campus engagement shoot me an e-mail. Starting next week I will begin updating the events page with relevant information. It's also worth mentioning that tomorrow night (Thursday) there will be an event you can go to called "Final Thursday". This consist of short story readings, and takes place at LINK. I'll talk more about campus engagements next class.

*Finally this is my plug for the twitter feed. I'm going to keep doing this until I get at least 15 followers*
