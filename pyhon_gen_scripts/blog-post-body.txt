Today we started with an activity oriented towards learning everyone's names. Hopefully, it worked! I'm starting to get a handle on who is who. We then watched a good chunk of Inside Man Season 1 Episode 4 on Netflix. It was all about deconstructing the educational system in Finland, and comparing it to the US. As we watched we took time in class to discuss some of the key elements. Next Wednesday we have a play we will attend during classtime (I'm sure we'll discuss it more on Monday). It was a great first week, and you all have been great to work with.

WE CHANGED THE REQUIRED READINGS FOR NEXT WEEK.

Homework for next Wednesday: read the following stories from the book The Best American Nonrequired Reading 2015 (That book you got over the summer). You will also be required to do your first weekly rundown. Try to reflect upon each story individually, and think about what worked/didn't work. You should avoid summarizing the story, as we all know how the stories play out. Instead, focus on your thoughts. In other words don't summarize the story, summarize your thoughts/feelings (Readings due Wednesday. Rundown due Friday). I will e-mail you an example rundown from when I was in class.

- Wear areas (pg. 115)
- You are in the dark, in the car (pg. 139)
- The Contestant (pg. 76)
- Our Neighbors House (pg. 207) 

- You will also be e-mailed the story Man From The South so make sure to read that.

We also went over campus engagements today in class! You have to do 5 each semester. I won't go over the info again for the sake of redundancy. I will be going to at least 5 this semester, and will go with a group of fellow classmates. This way you won't have to go to any alone if you don't want to!
