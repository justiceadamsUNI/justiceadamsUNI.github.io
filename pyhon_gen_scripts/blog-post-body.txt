Today we started with a group speech on earthquake awareness and how we can utilize the power of animals to identify earthquakes days before current technology. After some confusion regarding the funding, almost everyone decided to fund the research in our hypothetical situation.

After the speech, Nick took some time to address the situation for next Monday. Monday, May 1st we will be having class so that the final group can give their speech...but there's a Pizza party! We will be bringing in pizza for the class to celebrate our last day together. After voting on pizza flavors, we decided on Pepperoni, Sausage, Pineapple, and Just cheese. Hit us up if you prefer anything different.

Also, don't forget about your final paper which makes a case for your spring semester grade. And don't forget your campus engagement paper. That info can be found --here--.
