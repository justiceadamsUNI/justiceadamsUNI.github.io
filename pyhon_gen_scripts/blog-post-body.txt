Wednesday in class we continued playing two truths and a lie for most of the class. Turns out everyone else is a good liar except for me ¯\_(?)_/¯ . Nick talked about the fact that narrative is usually what makes a lie believable and to further illustrate this we ended up watching the following youtube video from the British TV show Would I Lie to You.

Thursday we will be going to the Final Thursday reading as a group so check your e-mails and the website for more info. I'm also going to plug Blair's vocal concert which is Sunday @ 8pm in GBPAC great hall. It's free and it would be a great campus engagement. Anyway here's your homework.
