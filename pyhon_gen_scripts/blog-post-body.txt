Friday in class we deconstructed the rest of the characters within Harvey. We discussed the various gender roles that were prevalant upon discussing the characters. Mary chase wrote Harvey in a way such that if you look for it, you can see the inner examination of sexism in the 1920s-1940s. Of course, you could also read the entire playwright and not even think about gender, that's kind of the beauty of the play. We also took some time to discuss alcohol's role within the play, specifically with Elwood. Nick then went on to explain the muddled history the U.S. has with alcohol. We'll be reading Ishmael for next week! This was my favorite reading when I took cornerstone, and I recommend really trying to deconstruct the text as you read! Anyway, your homework is below. Next week you should do written rundowns.

Homework for Friday: 
read the following section from Ishmael by Daniel Quinn:
- The first quarter of the text (pg. 3-75)

and the following from Calvin and Hobbes: 
- Haircut (pg. 46-50)
- Reality (pg. 51-53)
- The Transmorgifier (pg. 54-59)
- G.R.O.S.S (pg. 135-145)

Next Wednesday we will be going to see Paul Crenshaw during class, and there will also be a talk open to the public in Lang Auditorium from 7-9pm. I'll get you more details next week (you don't have to go to both). Here's a pdf with some additional info.
