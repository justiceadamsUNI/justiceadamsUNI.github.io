Hopefully, you all enjoyed the pizza party today! I hope you did. I won't post much of anything else on this post, but I just wanted to say thank you!

When I decided to do this last summer, I never would have thought you guys would be such an awesome class. I consider each and every one of you to be a friend. Hopefully, you stay in touch! I'm unlocking my twitter now that my peer mentorship is done, feel free to get ahold of me whenever you guys want. If you ever have any questions on anything, need help, or just want to see what's up, feel free to hit me up!

I can't express how cool it was to work with all of you throughout the year, I just hope you feel like you learned something in Nicks class. More importantly, I hope I was able to contribute to that learning. Throughout my sophomore year, i found myself constantly applying the stuff I learned in cornerstone, especially the pillars. This is one of the reasons I decided to become a peer mentor: because I thought the class was extremely valuable.

As for this website, it is done. There will be no more post, nor events updates. I hope you guys found it usefull throughout the year.

Again, thank you, you're all incredible people. Have a good summer and good luck on finals guys.
