Friday we started with creating a character. Each person listed features, characteristics, and traits their character possesses for about 5 minutes. We then used these characters as a jumping off point later in the class. After watching a clip of how Samurai Jack story writers created an episode of the animated series, everyone split into groups and did the same.


Each group was supposed to create a story and (potentially) use the characters they created earlier. Ideally, each group should have some pictures to go along with their brief story. Almost like a comic strip! We will share these next time.

Don't forget about your essay due before the end of the semester as well as your campus engagements. Next week I hope to show you all the UNI scholarship application.
