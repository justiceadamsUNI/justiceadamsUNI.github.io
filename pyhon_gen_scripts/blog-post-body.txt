Friday we had two speeches once again, hopefully soon Jacob will get to share his extra information with the class! Anyway, Niko gave a speech about paying student athletes. It was interesting to hear his perspective being that he's on the football team.

After Niko Abby gave a speech about ACL tears and why they are becoming more common in sports. We are approaching the last week of individual speeches! Don't forget about your group speeches, please. You're almost done!

Don't forget that this Tuesday there's another open mic event and I'll be taking a group!
