Tomorrow at 9pm there is an observatory visit at McCollum Science Hall. This will consist of looking through a telescope, and learning about the various visible constellations (probably). It would be an awesome campus engagement! I really enjoyed it when I went as a freshman.

Anyway, a good amount of us plan to meet up, and all go to the observatory together. If you don't want to go to a campus engagement alone, or just love astronomy you should come! We are going to meet at 8:50PM at the fountain outside of Maucker Union. It's in-between Maucker and Wright hall. Then when it's just a couple minutes from 9, we'll head over. You should all come, it's going to be awesome.

I will e-mail all of this information to you, and if you have any questions feel free to ask. The estimated time of the event is 30 min - 1 hour. Here is a link with tons of useful information. 

I hope to see you there!
