Today each of the groups got to spend the entirety of the class time working on their group projects. Each group found a section in the library and then shared their research article from last Friday. After sharing articles and tossing around some ideas each of the groups spent the rest of the time working on their group presentations. Nick and I walked around and helped each of you. It was really cool to hear some of your guy's ideas. As the project goes forth, if you run into any snags or don't know what to do, feel free to email me!- link is on the footer of the page :)

Some housekeeping stuff for you,

Wednesday, February 7th there will be an open mic night in Seerley Hall. This will operate much like the final Thursday's and TWLOHA event we went to a while back (in fact it will be the exact same for the most part). The show is titled "Real Community hot Mic Night" and takes place at 7 pm in the Great Reading Room of Seerley Hall. I'm spreading the word now just to give you a heads up, but of course, I will remind you as we get closer. I plan on taking a group and you get a check-plus for going and doing a write-up. I highly encourage you to go!

Speaking of check plusses, Nick alerted everyone in class today that if you start a group chat on WeChat then you can receive a check plus. WeChat is a slick messaging app that allows users to easily communicate across web browsers, Android, and iPhone.

-Wechatt for android
-Wechat for Iphone
-Web wechat.

Start a group, have everyone send a message with their names, and take a screenshot. Then have one of your group members send the picture to nick via e-mail - again link in the footer :). Easy check plus!

Finally, Wednesday is another student service session in the commons. This means of course that you shouldn't go to class in Lang Hall, but rather you should go to the commons. There will *probably* be an attendance sheet there, so I recommend going. I will tweet and email this info to you as well. You are being asked to print off and bring a copy of ---This PDF--- I will also be bringing extras, in case you forget. That is all, I'm done for now.
