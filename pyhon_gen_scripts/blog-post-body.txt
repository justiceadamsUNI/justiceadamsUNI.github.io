Today in class we moved into room 12 and started discussing the various stories as a class. This took up the entire class time. As we went around and said what we thought, we also took attendance on our attendance sheets in order to learn everyone's names better. Nick also talked a bit about the concept of allegory. According to Oxford dictionary allegory is defined as "A story, poem, or picture which can be interpreted to reveal a hidden meaning, typically a moral or political one".

Homework for next class Week: 

read the following stories from We Live in Water by Jess Walter.
- Anything Helps (pg. 1)
- Thief (pg. 41)
- Helpless Little Things (pg. 69)
- The Wolf and the Wild (pg. 133)

and the following sections from Calvin and Hobbes:
- Cast and Intro (pages 6-31)
- Guilt and Hobbes (pages 32-35)

You should read the following stories before Wednesday, and again have the rundowns done by Friday. This will be the normal routine.

It was great to see you all at the observatory on Thursday night! Hopefully you all enjoyed it.
