Wednesday in class we split into small groups and we discussed escapism in Wall-E, we took votes on each story for the week, and we discussed what makes eve beautiful in the film. Each group wrote on the whiteboard what they thought made eve beautiful. Some said the fact that she's bright white makes her beautiful, some said her advanced tech makes her beautiful to Wall-E, and a few said Wall-E likes her because she's "thick". After this nick discussed a bit about the pillars within Wall-E, and went on to talk about juxtaposition. Juxtaposition is defined on dictionary.com as "an act or instance of placing close together or side by side, especially for comparison or contrast". We talked about the juxtaposition of comparing old/dirty Wall-E to clean/high tech Eve. Anyway here is your homework.
