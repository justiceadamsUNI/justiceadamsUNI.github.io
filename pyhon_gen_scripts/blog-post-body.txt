Today you all split up into your groups, but instead of working on your group projects we did something different. You each came up with a solution to the underage drinking "problem". Each group will put forth a bill altering the current drinking laws in some way.It can be in favor of the current drinking age, or against it. This will give you a bit more experience speaking in front of the class before you go for gold in your individual and group speeches. As you all were working on your solutions I walked around helped while simaltaneously harrasing everybody about their individual speech sign up days. We only had one group present their bills today since we ran out of time, but they had some great ideas.

If you have not signed up for your speech YOU NEED TO DO SO --Here--. If you are not signed up by spring break, then I'm signing you up and whatever date I pick you will get. Nick and I have decided to extend the individual speech dates one more week for those of you who aren't yet signed up. We'll have 6 group speeches in the following weeks after (or before) the individual speeches are completed. 

Nick also took a few moments to alert everyone that If you read his story that he read on Monday and evaluate it in a check-plus-like rundown, you could earn a check plus! Read the piece, think about it deconstrcuctively, earn a check plus. Simple, right?

Also I have more office hours. Read more about that --Here--. I won't be in class on Friday so I'll see you all Monday. Have a great weekend!
