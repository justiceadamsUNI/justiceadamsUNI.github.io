Today I started with handing back all campus engagements, so if yo expected one but didn't get one back... I probably lost it. Let me know. We then talked about voice. One of the pillars we'll work with this year. Apparently, only 5 people have been graded on voice in high school writing. Voice is how words cut across reality and create feeling inside the reader/viewer/listener. Here's a video of Louis CK we watched in class 


and the corresponding table we made showing his voice from the video. It focuses on the words he used, and how it made us feel as we watched. Voice is directly linked to perspective/point of view, and this is Loius point of view.

We then wrote about Voice for a bit answering questions like what voices are important in your life? and who has a good voice? For me, as someone who listens to 40+ hours a week of audio podcast, I thought of my boy Joe Rogan. One of the best podcasters to ever live. He captivates listeners with his voice, and over the years you can see his progression as a host. I'll stop nerding-out now. Here's your homework

Next class (Wednesday 10/3) the fine people from over at the financial aid office, as well as some of the folks from career services office will talk to us during class. The first portion of the class will be about financial literacy, and the second portion of the class will be about financial awareness. It's highly recommended that you go to these. (I think the career services presentation is actually pretty good). It's at the commons just like last time, so go straight there for class. Anyway here's a -link to the location- . All this info will be e-mailed to you and tweeted out.
