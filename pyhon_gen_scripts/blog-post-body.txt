 Weclome to cornerstone! I'm your peer mentor Justice, and I look forward to meeting you all in class. Throughout the year I'll be here to help enhance your first year experience. I'm open to any and all questions: how to get to class, what the best place to eat is, how to study efficiently, and of course questions about Cornerstone. This website should keep you up to date with everything related to the class, plus anything else I find interesting. After every class I'll update the page with a recap of what we did in class/what you should do before the next period. I also have included pages for student resources as well as a weekly updated page for on campus events. I don't really know what else to put here, but I'll have plenty more to say about both myself and the webssite when we meet. I look forward to helping make your first year experience the best it can possibly be. Welcome to cornerstone. Welcome to UNI.
