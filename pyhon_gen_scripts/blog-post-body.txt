Friday we started by discussing the rundowns for next week. You'll have to do audio rundowns once more, and as part of your rundown you'll need to read a piece of fiction at the very end. The idea is that you do ~5 takes and then try to filter out the best version of yourself reading. By hearing your own voice as you speak you'll be able to adjust properly and become better public speakers. If you want, go see the example rundown I e-mailed you a few weeks back as it has me reading a poem at the end.

Anyway, in class, we discussed Ishmael's first portion together. It seemed that most people liked it. The question was raised "why does Daniel Quinn name the gorilla Ishmael?" which I'm still not entirely sure of the answer. The picture for this post is Abraham Casting Out Hagar and Ishmael from the bible.

Here's your homework for next week:
read the following section from Ishmael by Daniel Quinn: 
- The second quarter of the text (pg. 79-148) 

and the following from Calvin and Hobbes: 
- Overpopulation (pg. 193) 
- Growing up (pg. 194-199)

you will also be emailed the following story to read
- Puddles

I plan on introducing you guys to the myUniverse registration system sometime this week to show you how to register for classes.
