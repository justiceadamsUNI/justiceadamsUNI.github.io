Wednesday we had a bit of a communication error so instead of doing a group speech like planned, we went ahead with a lesson instead. Everyone started with a writing exercise. The goal was to come up with one thing you liked about the curriculum and one thing you didn't like and then expand on those. Nick will use this feedback in the coming years.

Many of you had decided that anonymous voting was better when evaluating the individual speeches and that also Nick should always have to vote. This lead to some interesting discussions about anonymity. We then watched some clips from shark tank and deconstructed the entrepreneur's gameplan.

Here's one of the clips we watched in class (sorry for poor quality).

You will be getting another e-mail as a reminder about the campus engagement paper you are supposed to write before finals week. Don't forget!
