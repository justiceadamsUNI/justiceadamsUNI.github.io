Today in class we talked about universal appeal and how most marketing campaigns play on the idea of universal appeal. More importantly, appeal is an important pillar that most authors use in their stories. We watched the following videos in class to examine examples of universal appeal. That's why I chose the super cute dog as the post image. If you don't understand that... you will in a second.

 - How we feel when people disagree
