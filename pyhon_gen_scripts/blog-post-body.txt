Friday we continued our discussion of chapter 9 of Ishmael. The remaining groups shared their analysis and we discussed it as a class. This lead directly in to the deconstruction of Genesis 1-4 which we examined in class. Nick talked about each line in Genesis 1-4 and how it relates to Ishmael. The first portion of genesis is filed with the pillars of story-telling we focus on as a class.
