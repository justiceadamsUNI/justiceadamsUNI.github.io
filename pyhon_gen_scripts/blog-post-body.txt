Today we had two more speeches as expected. Reanna started by giving her speech on why abortion is wrong and provided some interesting statistics on the subject.

After Reanna, Hannah gave a speech on optimism and how it can greatly enhance your life both mentally and physically. But how could you possibly be anything but optimistic with a peer mentor this cool. It's just not possible.

A REMINDER: Do not forget about your group speeches guys. We have this week, next week, then bam it's group speech time. Make sure you're meeting with your group and getting everything finalized as we approach the end of the semester. As always, feel free to e-mail me anytime or stop by my office hours if you need help. I plan on sending an e-mail reminder as well. See ya Wednesday!
