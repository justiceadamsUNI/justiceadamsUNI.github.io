Today you all spent the entire class doing group work. Me and Nick floated around and assisted the various groups with your speeches.

It was great to see everything you all have done and if you guys ever have any questions, feel free to e-mail me or Nick (Or come to my office hours) :)

Keep your two article annotations that you did for this week. You'll turn them in next time *probably*. We have some individual speeches next time so we'll see if Nick collects them. 

P.S. don't forget to sign up for individual speech dates!
