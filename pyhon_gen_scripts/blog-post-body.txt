Today Nick started with a discussion of the rhetorical triangle. We discussed the concept of the triangle briefly which you can read about here, or you can see the slick diagram I cooked up below. 


The diagram I made represents how Nick taught it to you guys. We then applied the rhetorical triangle to a lengthy discussion about the Super Bowl and how companies try to use the pillars in an attempt to get their message across. I have attached both the relevant super bowl commercials we discussed below.



We then watched the following TED talk as a class which surprisingly was quite relatable to Ishmael!

After watching you all split into small groups and discussed both the TED talk and the story you read for today "Harrison Bergeron". In both cases, the class voted and most of you guys liked both the TED talk and the short story you read for today!

Here's a reminder that Wednesday we are in the Commons for a student services session! Check your e-mails for all the relevant info and the documents you need to print off! Or alternatively, see the last class recap -- ToDo: Here--

Also, a reminder that Tomorrow I will be leading a group to go to the community open mic event which Nick and Travis (the other cornerstone professor) will be reading at. More on that ---ToDo Here---. I hope to see you all there!


Homework for Friday: If you didn't turn in both copies of your revised story do so on Friday. If you send nick a few audio recordings from during your edit process and he can see what you decided to change when looking at your new versions you will get a check plus. I'd mention in the audio "I didn't like how X sentence sounded so I'm going to change it" at the end of the file!
